# If you want to use URL rewriting like api/create_game instead of api/create_game.php
# you would add RewriteRules here. For now, we'll use direct .php file access.
# Example (not used in current setup):
# RewriteEngine On
# RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
# RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
# RewriteRule ^([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)$ $1.php [L]
