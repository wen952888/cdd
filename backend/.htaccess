# You might want to deny access to the includes folder if it were directly under web root
# For example, if includes was at /backend/includes and /backend was web root:
# <IfModule mod_authz_core.c>
#    Require all denied
# </IfModule>
# <IfModule !mod_authz_core.c>
#    Order deny,allow
#    Deny from all
# </IfModule>
# However, in our structure, includes is not directly web accessible if only api/ is the entry.
